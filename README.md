### My name is Nehemiah Boone - Full-Stack Software Developer

I'm software developer with a passion for problem solving and working cohesively with others. Experienced with various front and back-end technologies and building full stack applications.

I found my interest in development early in my life, and after several months of teaching myself I found Boise CodeWorks! A bootcamp that teaches Full-Stack Development has also showed me my ability to learn quickly and grow consistently, and I am now looking to begin a long career of growth!
